                    <h2>Gameplay & Game Design</h2>
                    <p class="content">During the game design discussion, I came up with a game mechanic based on how children handle fear. When they are afraid, children usually hide their eyes with their hands: if they cannot see the monster, he will not see them. <br><br>
                        We implemented this mechanic in Optophobia. When the player encounters the Creature, he’ll need to hide and close his eyes after breaking its chaser’s line of sight. Hiding and closing his eyes allow the player to progress in the haunted manor and unveil its mysteries. 
                        </p>

                    <h2>Level Design</h2>
                    <p class="content">I designed and implemented the first two levels of the game. They take place in an old manor with a lot of entangled hallways in order to create a labyrinthic effect.  </p>

                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p class="content">The game was developed using the 2019 version of Unity. I implemented the different behaviors of the Creature (Wander, Follow) using the Unity Navmesh component with a system of nodes for the navigation and raycasting for the line of sight. <br><br>
                        The challenge for the Creature was to elaborate an AI that responded to the rhythm of the game. The scripts I worked on allow the level designers to control the meeting frequency of the Creature and its spawn positions which are really important to ensure the horror effect and staging in the game.</p>
