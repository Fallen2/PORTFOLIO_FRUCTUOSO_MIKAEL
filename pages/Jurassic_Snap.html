                        <p class="content">Jurassic Snap got mainly inspired by the Pokemon Snap IP on its game design: <strong>players have to interact with creatures and snap them</strong> in order to progress through the game. The main difference between these two games is that Jurassic Snap aims for a <strong>deployment on VR platforms</strong> and <strong>provides a more accurate and realistic experience</strong>.

                        <h2>What I learned from this experience</h2>
                        <p class="content"> My 6 months internship at Dreamirl showed me behind the scenes of an Indie game studio, allowing me to test my skills in a professional game making environment. Here some insights about what I learned from this experience :</p>
                        <ul  class="content">
                            <li><strong>Problems need to be raised as soon as they emerge</strong>. Some issues could have been resolved more efficiently by sharing them with the team in the earlier stages of the project.</li>
                            <li><strong>Technology watch needs to be done before everything else</strong>. Several features were developed from scratch when plugins could have saved us a lot of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Build as much as you can</strong>. The goal was a release on Quest 2 but builds were made too late in the planning. Some features didn’t work as expected on the device and optimization issues emerged too close to the release date.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication is key</strong>. Giving feedback on each others work highly improved group cohesion and the overall project quality. </li>
                        </ul>
