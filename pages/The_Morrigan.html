                        <h2>A unique combat system inspired by fencing. Position yourself, dodge and hit your foes ! </h2>
                        <p class="content">The main protagonist of our game is a Young Celt, a woman overtrained to face the abomination living in the forest. Even overtrained she remains human, so we wanted the player to fight enemies that could kill her with pure strength, but also ones that could be killed efficiently with a precise blow, as represented in the <strong>David and Goliath</strong> myth. Our goal was to <strong>make the player feel proud of himself after beating each enemy</strong>, and even prouder if he took no damage during the process. 
                        <br><br>Thus, we imagined that enemies had <strong>weak points</strong> placed on their body and provided the player a kit of movement that allowed him to dodge incoming attacks if well-timed and hit weak points precisely. A spear seemed to be the best answer to our demands, providing both <strong>range and precision while keeping the thrill brought by close combat situations</strong>.

                        <h2>A health corruption mechanic rewarding precision.</h2>
                        <p class="content">In order to encourage players to take advantage of our weak point system, we designed a second mechanic based on attack optimization and precision as a support of our core gameplay: <strong>the corruption</strong>. The Danann Forest is full of former humans that got cursed by a god for their misbehavior towards him, they are now controlled by a corrupted liquid called the “Altered Sap”. The idea was that hitting them on a non-weak point spot would project some Altered Sap that would hurt the player.
                            <br><br>Thus, we designed health points that could be in three different states: Full, empty and <strong>corrupted health points</strong>. Corrupted health points are <strong>borrowed to the player when he hits an enemy on a non-weak point spot</strong> and <strong>are lost in addition to full health points</strong> when the player is damaged. However, corrupted health points<strong> can be recovered </strong> with a conclusive <strong>hit in the enemy’s weak point</strong> or on enemy death. With this mechanic, we expect experienced player to optimize their fight, alternating between normal hits and weak point hits.

                            Thus, we opted for an <strong>item-based progression system</strong> so we could spread items around the map to <strong>reward exploration</strong>, <strong>relate narrative content</strong> on their description and leave us the opportunity to <strong>acquire them at merch sites</strong>.
