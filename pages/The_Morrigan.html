                        <p class="content">The Morrígan is <strong>a light rpg souls-like</strong> in which the player embodies a Young Celt willing to sacrifice in order to save her people. In the game, players will explore the dangerous Danann Forest and fight against the Abominations living there.
                            The game is developed by <strong>a 10 students team</strong> as part of the Master’s degree in Management, Video Games, Image and Creativity at the University of Côte d’Azur. It will soon be presented at the <strong>Festival International des Jeux Vidéo at Cannes</strong>.
                            In the project, I held the positions of <strong>Lead Gameplay Programmer</strong> and <strong>Scrum Master</strong>. I was also involved in the <strong>game design process</strong>.

                        <h2>A unique combat system inspired by fencing. Position yourself, dodge and hit your foes ! </h2>
                        <p class="content">The main protagonist of our game is a Young Celt, a woman overtrained to face the abomination living in the Danann forest. Even overtrained she remains human, so we wanted the player to fight enemies that could kill her with pure strength, but also ones that could be killed efficiently with a precise blow, as represented in the <strong>David and Goliath</strong> myth. Our goal was to <strong>make the player feel proud of himself after beating each enemy</strong> and even prouder if he took no damage during the fight. 
                        <br><br>Thus, we designed enemies with <strong>weak points</strong> placed on their bodies and provided players with a movement kit that allows them to dodge incoming attacks if well-timed and hit weak points with precision. A spear seemed to be the best answer to our design goals, providing both <strong>range and precision while keeping the thrill brought by close combat situations</strong>.

                        <h2>A health corruption mechanic rewarding precision.</h2>
                        <p class="content">In order to encourage players to take advantage of our weak point system, we designed a second mechanic based on attack optimization and precision as a support of our core gameplay: <strong>the corruption</strong>. The Danann Forest is full of former humans that got cursed by a Celtic god for their misbehavior towards him, they are now controlled by a corrupted liquid called the “Altered Sap”. Hitting them on a non-weak point spot will spill some Altered Sap that will hurt the player.
                            <br><br>Thus, we designed health points that could be in three different states: Full, empty and <strong>corrupted health points</strong>. Corrupted health points are <strong>borrowed to the player when he hits an enemy on a non-weak point spot</strong> and <strong>are lost in addition to full health points</strong> when the player is damaged. However, corrupted health points<strong> can be recovered </strong> with a conclusive <strong>hit in the enemy’s weak point</strong> or on enemy death. With this mechanic, we expect experienced player to optimize their fight, alternating between normal hits and weak point hits.

                            Thus, we opted for an <strong>item-based progression system</strong> so we could spread items through the map to <strong>reward exploration</strong>, <strong>relate narrative content</strong> on their description and leave players the opportunity to <strong>acquire them at merch sites</strong>.
